The Spotify Group Recommendation Apps goal is to provide awesome playlists that satisfies every party member.
For this we use our own machine learning implementation that creates playlists based on the preferences of all group members.

## How It Works

Simply register on our website and form groups with the people you want to enjoy a playlist with. After you formed your group you can specify further parameters (like genres) or simply hit create and we will generate a playlist for you that you can integrate into your Spotify account.

## Development

Spotify provides [guidance](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/) in term of creating apps that integrate with Spotify. E.g. it describes how to get access tokens to interact with the Spotify API, which is exactly what we need,

### VS Code

The workspace file includes recommendations for vs code extensions.

## User Interface

The user interface was built with Angular. Check the Readme under spotify-group-recommendation.ui for more.

## Backend

The backend API is built with Python. Check it's Readme for information.
